## As the advertiser

Once an advertiser owns an AdSpace, they can set the ad data they want to display on the web by calling
the `updateAdURI` method on the CommonAdSpaces contract.

As of writing the AdLand app uses the
standard ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema for you to insert your ad, though anything can be used.

Stronger ad data typings coming soon

## As the client

Simple web ads can be displayed by clients in any format by simply calling the `getAdUri` onchain
or by calling the appropriate API endpoint provided. Here no AdStrategy is implemented, and the ad lives
directly at the ad uri.
