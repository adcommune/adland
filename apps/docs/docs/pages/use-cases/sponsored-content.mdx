# Sponsored Ads

Leveraging a custom AdStrategy & an [EAS](https://attest.org/) attestation we can let two parties strike
a deal over what will be displayed in the ad space.

## How it works

A custom ad strategy is set for a specific AdSpace. The strategy is used in order to add
custom logic when resolving the ad to be displayed. In this case, the strategy will use
an EAS attestation to let two parties agree on what will be displayed in the ad space.
