# What is AdLand ?

Adland is a simple advertising protocol that allows any community to earn
revenue from onchain advertising spaces in a transparent, decentralized & efficient manner. The advertising spaces are held
by advertisers in the form of a plurally owned asset.

Contrary to private property, **plural property** is a system of ownership where assets belong to no one and
everyone and are ruled by the following principles:

1. An asset owner must **self-assess** its value and broadcast it to the community.
2. Anyone should be able to **buy the asset at any time**. Owners cannot refuse to sell.
3. Asset owners must **pay a tax** to the community that is directly proportional to the self-assessed value.

## How it works

1. An individual or community decide it needs revenue in order to grow or sustain itself. They
can open an **AdGroup** on the protocol specifying an initial price and tax rate (in % of asset price / week).

2. Advertisers can now buy inidividual **AdSpaces**. In the case of plural property, the buyer is actually
acquire a lease certificate (in the form of an NFT) which he can then manage as he pleases, by self-assessing
price and mangagin the Ad data. As soon as a advertiser buys an AdSpace, he'll start streaming (second-by-second token transfers) tax to the AdGroup
beneficiary.

3. AdGroups beneficiaries, **AdGroupAdmins** are smart accounts that recieve all revenue from tax and purchases (from initial sales or renounced asset resale) and
the right to manage that revenue. Any strategies can then be implemented for distribution (managed, split, pool, ...).

4. Finally, as of writing, *Ad Data* is simply stored as a uri in the Ad contract.
