# What is AdLand ?

Adland is a simple advertising protocol that allows any community to earn
revenue from onchain advertising spaces in a transparent, decentralized & efficient manner. The advertising spaces are held
by advertisers in the form of a plurally owned asset.

Contrary to private property, **plural property** is a system of ownership where assets belong to no one and
everyone and are ruled by the following principles:

1. An asset owner must **self-assess** its value and broadcast it to the community.
2. Anyone should be able to **buy the asset at any time**. Owners cannot refuse to sell.
3. Asset owners must **pay a tax** to the community that is directly proportional to the self-assessed value.

## How it works

1. An individual or community decide it needs revenue in order to grow or sustain itself. They
can open a number of **AdSpaces** on the protocol specifying an initial price and tax rate (in % of asset price / week).

2. Advertisers can now buy theses inidividual *AdSpaces*. In the case of plural property, the buyer is actually
acquire a lease certificate (in the form of an NFT) which he can then manage as he pleases, by self-assessing
price and mangagin the Ad data. As soon as a advertiser buys an *AdSpaces*, he'll start streaming (second-by-second token transfers) tax to the AdGroup
admin.

3. **AdGroupAdmins** are smart accounts that recieve all revenue from tax and purchases (from initial sales or renounced asset resale) and
the right to manage that revenue. Any strategies can then be implemented for distribution (managed, split, pool, ...).

4. Finally, *AdSpace* owners can set the data for their ad space, while *AdGroupAdmins* can set a custom AdStrategy to incorporate their own logic for resolving ad data.

### Perpetual Listings

Adland's marketplace makes assets available for purchase at any time by making listings **perpetual**: when a purchase is made, the listing is still up. Thus the ERC721 token behind each
listing only represents the current owner of the asset (making them "Marketplacebound" NFTs).

### Taxes

Taxes are paid by advertisers to the AdGroupAdming in the form of payment streams. They are paid in [Superfluid SuperTokens](https://docs.superfluid.finance/docs/concepts/overview/super-tokens) streams managed directly by the marketplace during
the lifecycle of each *AdSpaces* leases.
- On purchase, a stream from buyer to AdGroupAdmin is created while the stream from seller to AdGroupAdmin is closed. 
- On self-assessment, the stream to be proportional to the self-assessed value and the tax rate.
- On renouncement, the stream is closed.
- On forclosure, the stream is closed and the asset is put back on the market by the AdGroupAdmin.

### AdGroupAdmin

AdGroup creators are handed a AdGroupAdmin tokenbound smart account to manage the AdGroup.

### AdSpace

AdSpaces are the ad space ownership certificates needed in order to submit your adversiting data.
